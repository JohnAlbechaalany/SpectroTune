# SpectroTune
SpectroTune is a R package designed for predictive modeling of spectroscopic data using a nested cross-validation (CV) framework. The package integrates both outer CV loops (for unbiased model evaluation) and inner CV loops (for hyperparameter tuning), ensuring robust and reproducible calibration in spectroscopic applications.
